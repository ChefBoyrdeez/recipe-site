    <img src="./recipephotos/carbonara.jpeg">
    <p>Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish made with eggs, cheese, cured pork, and black pepper.
        The cheese is a Parmigiano-Reggiano or Pecorino Romano. Sometimes even  a mixture between the two.
        Spaghetti is the most common pasta, but fettuccine, rigatoni, and linguine are also used.
        Pancetta (bacon) is the typical cured pork. It is considered an "urban" dish in Italian cuisine and is a newer recipe.
